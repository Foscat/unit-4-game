# unit-4-game

A random target number is generated at the start of the game.

You have 4 crystals that also have random numbers assigned to them.

When you click the crystals your total goes up by that crystals value. 

The object of the game is to get your total to match with the target total.

If the numbers match you win, if the score goes over then you lose.

Either way a new round stars and the scorecard that tracks wisn and losses changes accordingly.
